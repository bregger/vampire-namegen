== HOW TO BE A VAMPIRE ==
=========================

We are VAMPIREs. But, that doesn't mean we're not people too. We suck blood,
but not too much. Thank you for understanding.


On The Topic of Ethics
* A VAMPIRE shall not suck too much blood.
   * Only enough to survive.
   * A little more is OK because sometimes you get hungry.
* A VAMPIRE shall wear a shirt at all times in public.
* A VAMPIRE shall not apply hair gel.
